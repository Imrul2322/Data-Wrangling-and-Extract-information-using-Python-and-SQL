# Data Wrangling, Extract Information from Sales Raw Data - Python, SQL

## Summary
Worked with a data which needed a lot of works to extract useful information. Created relational tables using different information like countries, regions, customers, products and orders.  For each category, extracted total amount of sales and recommended which products, countries and regions are ahead in sales. 

## Data Preparation
The file consists of 11 columns separated by tab and each row is a customer with all of the products they have ordered. Columns are Name, Address, City, Country, Region, ProductName, ProductCategory, ProductCategoryDescription, ProductUnitPrice, QuantityOrdered, OrderDate. Last six columns are linked. So, after zipping them up we get the one information from each column. Basically for each customer, we have multiple data for the last six columns.
